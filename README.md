Deepmaterial provides the wind turbine industry with bonding, sealing, damping and reinforcement solutions from foundation to blade tip.

The global renewable energy market is growing rapidly due to the need for alternative energy sources to replace traditional energy sources with limited supplies. Innovation is at the forefront of this growth, while maintaining the safety and cost-effectiveness of new technologies.

High-performance tapes are widely used in the renewable energy market due to their versatility and variety of properties. This blog post will discuss some of the applications where tape is used in the renewable energy market.

Wind energy is the process of using airflow through wind turbines to generate electricity. It is a popular renewable energy source because it produces no greenhouse gases and does not require a lot of space.

Wind energy does have some drawbacks, and tape is being used to help overcome some of them. Wind turbines are often placed in some of the harshest environments in the world, from deserts to the middle of the sea, which can put some stress on the turbines.

Protective films are used to provide protection for wind turbine blades subjected to harsh environments.

Vortex generators optimize airflow around the root of the blade, bonded with high-performance tape, and they are also used in aircraft designs for similar applications.

Wind turbines can also be a source of noise and vibration. The serrations are designed to reduce blade noise and improve power lift and are secured with high performance tape. The product is suitable for factory installation and retrofit applications due to its excellent adhesion at sub-zero temperatures.

To optimize lift, drag and moment coefficients, Gurney flaps are bonded to the blade surface using high performance tape.
